# BLOCKCHAIN-APPLICATION

#ðŸŽŸ Blockchain-for-Event-Tickets

A beginner-friendly blockchain implementation in Python for securely storing and verifying event tickets (movie shows, concerts, sports matches, etc.).
This project demonstrates how blockchain can ensure tamper-proof tickets, prevent fake/scalped tickets, and enable secure ticket transfer.

#ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Genesis block creation â€“ the first block starts the eventâ€™s ticket registry.
âœ… Add tickets â€“ issue tickets to users with seat number, event name, and ID.
âœ… Transfer tickets â€“ re-assign tickets securely (no black marketing).
âœ… Event-wise blockchain â€“ each event has its own ticket chain.
âœ… Verify ticket ownership â€“ check if a ticket is valid & who owns it.
âœ… Tamper-proof validation â€“ ensures tickets havenâ€™t been faked.
âœ… Interactive CLI menu â€“ issue, transfer, and verify tickets with user input.

#âš™ How It Works

When an event is created, it starts with a Genesis block (ticket registry).

Each issued ticket is stored as a block (with seat number + owner).

Tickets can be transferred to another person (new block added).

The blockchain links each record with SHA-256 hashes, ensuring no tampering.

Both organizers and customers can verify tickets to avoid scams.

#ðŸ”‘ Concepts Used

ðŸ§± Blockchain basics â€“ tickets are stored as linked blocks.
ðŸ”’ SHA-256 hashing â€“ prevents fake ticket creation.
âœ¨ Immutability â€“ no duplicate or forged tickets.
ðŸ“œ Traceability â€“ full history of ticket ownership.
âœ… Tamper detection â€“ validates ticket authenticity.
